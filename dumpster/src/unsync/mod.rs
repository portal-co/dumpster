//! Thread-local garbage collection.
//!
//! Most users of this library will want to direct their attention to [`Gc`].
//! If you want to tune the garbage collector's cleanup frequency, take a look at
//! [`set_collect_condition`].
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use dumpster::{unsync::Gc, Collectable};
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//!
//! #[derive(Collectable)]
//! struct Foo {
//!     refs: RefCell<Vec<Gc<Self>>>,
//! }
//!
//! let foo = Gc::new(Foo {
//!     refs: RefCell::new(Vec::new()),
//! });
//!
//! // If you had used `Rc`, this would be a memory leak.
//! // `Gc` can collect it, though!
//! foo.refs.borrow_mut().push(foo.clone());

///
/// While collecting cycles, it's possible for a `Gc` to exist that points to some deallocated

/// To prevent undefined behavior, these `Gc`s are marked as dead during collection and rendered
/// inaccessible.
/// Dereferencing or cloning a `Gc` during the `Drop` implementation of a `Collectable` type could
/// result in the program panicking to keep the program from accessing memory after freeing it.
